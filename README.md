### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Lilyflower here, but you can just call me Lily 
(unless you know my real name, but why would you know _that_ huh?)

#### So... a little about me
- I'm a still a student (though I won't be for much longer!)
- I play skycotl and Genshin Impact. Not that many games, but they are my favourites.
- One fun fact about me, is that I have been in the school choir for 8 years, so I guess you can say I have experience... kinda.
- Feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilyflowersky/">instagram</a>! I post... occasionally.
